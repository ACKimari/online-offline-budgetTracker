# Online-Offline Budget Tracker

## Description

This project was enlightening and challenging as it allowed me to understand how to create an application that functions both online and offline! This project is very crucial in today's world as travelling remains prevalent, depsite the current pandemic situation, thus the high need for applications that function in this manner.

I definitely enjoyed working on this project and my motivation was being able to understand how to create an app such as this.
## Steps

Step 1: Create a manifest.webmanifest file within the public folder and input the required info.

Step 2: Create a service-worker.js file within the fublic folder and input the code that allows you to have acces both offline and online.

Step 3: Ensure you have all the right files to cache listed within the server-worker.js file.

Step 4: Open Integrated terminal and run npm install, then mongod, the nodemon server.js.

Step 5: Now open it on your web and to check if it runs both offline and online, inspect the page and choose network, and where it says no throttling press the down arrow and choose offline. To ensure they both work, try adding things to your budget tracker while online and offline, and check your mongo app to see if they were captured.
